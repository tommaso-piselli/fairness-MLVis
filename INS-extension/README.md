# **Graph Layout Optimization with Stress and Unfairness Objectives using Gradient Descent (GD)**

## Notes
- Code based on the repository: https://github.com/bwilder0/fair_influmax_code_release and modified for our needs.
- To run the code: `computeLayout.py`
- The code in this state contains customs savings and drawings. Check `utils.py` and `model.py` for your needs.

- Python Version: `Python 3.10.11`

- CUDA Version: 


- Check `requirements.txt` for libraries. Run `computeLayout.py` to generate layouts. You can select a different input by changing the `name` variable with the name of the corresponding graph name.
You can find a list of possible graphs in the `data` folder.

- For torch run `pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`
